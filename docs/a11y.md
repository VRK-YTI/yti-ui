# Accessiility (a11y)

## Axe-core

Axe-core is an a11y checker that inspects DOM realtime in the browser. It is
used only in development, so you don't need to disable it before release. It
dumps warnings to the browser's console. Some problems may be false positives so
fixing everything is not super important.
