# mscr-ui

A user interface for the datamodel editor

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Installing node.js

This app runs on Node.js. You need to install it before you can continue.

The easiest way to install Node.js is to use
[nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm). We have defined Node.js version in
`.nvmrc` so you just need to run `nvm install` and `nvm use` to install the
correct version.

If you can't use nvm, check current Node.js version from `.nvmrc` and install it
manually.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Troubleshooting and more documentation

You can find more documentation in [docs](../docs).
